## What Server Side Characters are

<a name="5FqHY"></a>

##

Server Side Characters is a special mechanism designed for Terraria servers that forces players to start with fresh characters when they join. This means they lose *all* of their items. This is purely server-side, though, it will not affect their actual Singleplayer character. Server Side Characters are what you need if you wish to prevent people from bringing in items from other servers and/or singleplayer and force them to start from scratch.

### The SuperAdmin bypasses SSC

> The SuperAdmin account has all permissions on your server. This includes the permission to ignore Server Side Characters (\`\`
> `tshock.ignore.ssc`
> ).If you want to start with a fresh character and still have SuperAdmin privileges, create a new group and grant it the following permissions:
> *, !tshock.ignore.ssc
> . This will enable every permission (
> *
> ), then negate the SSC ignoring permission (
> !tshock.ignore.ssc
> ).Example:
> /group addperm <group name> * !tshock.ignore.ssc
