Using TShock, a more powerful Message Of The Day system is provided than what is currently implemented by default Terraria. In the \tshock folder resides a motd.txt configuration file that allows you to edit the message of the day to contain any message you want.
The following variables can be used inside your message:

- %map% - This displays the name of your world that your server is running.
- %players% - This lists the name of all the players who are currently logged into your server.

All Terraria message formatting codes should work also.
Example:
Welcome to my server!
\[c/FF0000:Current map:] %map%
Current players: %players%
